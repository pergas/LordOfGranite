    <h1>This may happen, ya know, one day. </h1>
    <p>This may turn into a site where you can get any homebrewed works by the Lord Of Granite for Dungeons and Dragons (5th Edition).</p>

    <p>You can Email him at <a href="Mailto:LordOfGranite@gmail.com">LordOfGranite@gmail.com</a> if for some reason you want to try and talk to him. He doesn't check it often at the moment so good luck.
