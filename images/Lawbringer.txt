##### Spell Slots
The Auger Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *Absorb Elements* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *Absorb Elements* using either slot.

##### Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher
You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the divination or abjuration spells on the bard spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Auger Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an divination or enchantment spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.
 
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an divination or enchantment spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

##### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, as you have learnt your spells through years of practice and innate ability. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
</div>

You employ tools that assist in magical investigation. You can use one of the following as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells: a notebook, a magnifying glass, a ten-foot pole or a lantern. 

#### Blacklight
*2nd-level Auger lawbringer feature*

When used this way, illusions created by spells of a level equal to or lower than your proficieny bonus are revealed. Common or uncommon magic items that cause illusions are also disrupted, revealing illusions. Creatures with darkvision can see this light in shades of grey. 

\page

#### Tracing Magic

*6th-level Auger Lawbringer feature*


From 6th level, your Auger senses can sense when magic has been actively used (a spell cast, or a magical effect triggered from an item or creature) within 30 feet of you in the last 24 hours. As an action, you can focus your senses onto a single instance of magic use and cause the lingering traces to transform into a Tracing Crystal. You can create a number of Tracing Crystals up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). If you try to create more than this, the oldest Tracing Crystal you have disintegrates. 

You can use the tracing crystals in the following ways. 

 * **Origin**: As an action, you can cause the gem to reveal the direction of the creature or item that created the magical effect. You must wait an hour before repeating this use. If you do so early, you gain the direction, but the crystal disintegrates.  
 * **Target**: As an action, you can cause the gem to reveal the direction of the target of the magical effect. You must wait an hour before repeating this use. If you do so early, you gain the direction, but the crystal disintegrates.  
 * **Owner**: As an action, you can crush the gem destroying it. If it was from an item that was attuned to a person, you learn the person's name. Otherwise, you learn what type of creature was the source of the magic. 
 * **Information** As an action, you can focus on the gem, and learn what properties the activation had (e.g. spell name/level, name of the object.
 * **Invoke**: As an action, you can attempt to recreate the effect. make a DC 15 Arcarna check. On a success, you recreate the magical effect, centered on the gem. If the source was an item, the gems truns into the item for 1 minute. If it was a spell, the spell targets the nearest creature within range (potentially yourself) at the lowest level it can be cast at. Once invoked, the gem disintegrates. 
 
#### Abjure Magic
*11th-level Auger lawbringer feature*

Starting at 11th level, you learn the spells *Counterspell* and *Dispel Magic*, if you do not already know them. You can cast each of these spells a number of times up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), regaining expended uses at the end of a long rest. You can also cast these normally if you have a spell slot of level 3 or higher. 

```
```

#### Magical Protection
*14th-level Auger lawbringer feature*

* Blinded
* Charmed
* Deafened
* Frightened
* Paralyzed
* Petrified
* Poisoned

You can use this effect a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, regaining expended uses at the end of a long rest. You can also use a spell slot to activate this effect, though it must be of equal of higher level than that of the spell creating the effect. if you use one lower, the effect still occurs, and you waste the spell slot. 

#### Magical Dampening Field
*18th-level Auger lawbringer feature*

From 18th level, you have perfected the ability to disrupt magic around you. As an action, you can create an magical dampening field in a 30-foot radius centered on you. You can maintain the field for up to 1 minute by concentrating on this effect as if it were a spell.
The field has these effects:
 * All creatures within range that can cast a spell must make an Intelligence saving throw vs your spellcasting DC at the start of their turn. On a failure, they are unable to cast a spell.
 * If a creature is suffereing from a magical effect, they can make their saving throws at the start of their turn instead of the end, and do so with advantage. 
 * If a creature tries to use a magical item, they must make an Arcarna (Intelligence) check against your spellcasting DC. On a failure, the action is wasted, with no effects. passive effects from magical items are supporessed while you concentrate on this effect. 
 * If a creature is within the field and targeted by a spell from outside, they have resistance to any damage dealt by the spell. 
 
Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

The skirmisher is a martial class for DnD 5th edition. This document is a first draft. 


## Design Notes
Outline of where this class came from 

### Rational for class skills

This section sets out what each class feature is trying to achieve. 
 
##### Fighting styles
I picked styles that focused on defening others as a lawbringer is, at heart, a defender of others. I feel they fit thematically with what I wanted. 
 
##### Name of the Law
Something to describe why this is the core mechanic.  

##### Multi Attack
As they are more a martial class than magical, I used the standard extra attack at level 5. 
 
 
```
```
  

### Subclass rational

I called  the subclass 'Warrants' due to the sound of it. I have a warrant to XYZ etc. 
 
##### Arbitor

Based on the idea of a wondering judge who carryies out sentances themself.
 
##### Auger

The Auger was my attempt to make a magical detective

 
##### Gendarme 

Based on the typical beatcop/patroller. 

 
##### Intuit

A psionic policeman, who uses their hunches to their advantage

##### Sleuth 

The classic grizziled dectective. 


 ### Optional Features
 
 These followed the lines of similar feature for classes as presented in *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*, to allow a little bit more flexibility or convenience.
